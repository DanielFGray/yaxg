  -g  defaults to saving as gif (will be overridden by file extension)
  -p  defaults to saving as png (will be overridden by file extension)
  -w  defaults to saving as webm (will be overridden by file extension)

  -h  print this help

CONFIGURATION:

A configuration file can saved at $XDG_CONFIG_DIR/yaxg/conf
(defaults to $HOME/.config/yaxg/conf if XDG_CONFIG_DIR is not set)
The config file accepts the following values:

  callback
    a callback string to execute
  filename
    a default filename to use when none is provided (must not include extension)
  format
    default format to use, must be either png, webm, or gif
  slop
    arguments to be passed to slop

SPECIAL STRINGS
Similar to `scrot`, the callback and filename parameters can take format
specifiers that are expanded when encountered. Characters preceded by
'%' are interpreted directly by the `date` commmand. See `man date` for examples.
Characters preceded by '$' are parsed by yaxg and expanded as such:

  $f  image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
